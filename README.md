# GLITCHYPSI CollabinaL<sub>(egacy)</sub>

A Discord bot made for collabs that have user-submitted links. Can be used for any kind of project that needs submissions.

## Why?

It was made for the [Sleeping Plant Calamity Collab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkmvVjLireY). I decided it would be good to hand it over to more people as well.

## Fair warning before cloning, self-hosting, contributing or using it

This bot was one of my first bots. The writing style and user experience may be subpar at best and I am accepting contributions to code only for the sake of those that actually wish to use it. I will of course still maintain it and improve its end-user experience.

There is no help file. Command help may be incomplete. Contact me through Discord or file an Issue if you have any concerns/complaints over usage or experience.
